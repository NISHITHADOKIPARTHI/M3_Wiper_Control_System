# Wiper Control System
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. 

In this proect we will build manually controlled wiper control system. We built a wiper control system using STM32F4 Discovery board. Here we use builtin button and LEDs to operate or visualize the project.We will control onboard four LEDs of STM32F4 discovery board with a push button.
